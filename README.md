In summary, using meta-analysis across three biobanks, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) was found to be associated with an increased risk for seropositive, but not seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

This finding was validated by testing the prevalence of CHIP among participants in a clinical RA cohort and comparing to the prevalence of CHIP among age matched controls. In this validation analysis, the prevalence of CHIP was found to be higher among cases than controls.
